<ul>
<li>We have learned many things through this project. :</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>effectively use special registers like the IR the MAR and the PC.</li>
<li>learned how to use a CU to manage Write Enable, Write Output for components.</li>
<li>Have learned how to use general registers; write to them and read from them.</li>
<li>Learned how to effectively control the Bus flow for data and addresses using buffers, decoders, and multiplexers.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Difficulties and hardships:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The general design of the CPU was not difficult, however needing to access direct memory for some instructions made the CU design difficult as we were not able to imagine or describe the flow of the CU. Thankfully after days of research, we found a video on YouTube that introduced a way to use the CU through instruction cycles, and that made us succeed in designing the CU.</li>
<li>We did not practice on Busses before, so to understand how to use them effectively required some time and process of thought.</li>
</ol>
